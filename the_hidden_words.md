### Part One

**From the Arabic**

HE IS THE GLORY OF GLORIES

This is an important message, originally from a heavenly place. Powerful prophets received it long ago. We've made it shorter and clearer, a gift for good people. By following it, they can stay true to their promises to God, live a good life as he wishes, and achieve great spiritual growth.

1 O SON OF SPIRIT!

My most important advice is this: Have a heart that is good, kind, and full of light. This way, your influence and legacy will be powerful and will last forever.

2 O SON OF SPIRIT!

The most important thing to me is justice.  If you want me to love and trust you, never turn away from being fair. Through justice, you'll see the world clearly and gain your own wisdom, instead of relying on others.  Understand this deeply â€“ justice is my gift to you, showing my love. Always keep it in your sight.

3 O SON OF MAN!

I have loved you since the beginning of time. That's why I created you in my image and showed you the beauty within yourself.

4 O SON OF MAN!

I loved you even before I created you. So, please love me in return. If you do, I will recognize your worth and fill your spirit with life and meaning.

5 O SON OF BEING!

Love me, so I can love you back. If you don't love me, my love won't be able to reach you. Please understand this.

6 O SON OF BEING!

My love is your true paradise, the ultimate heavenly home.  Reunite with me in this love, and don't hesitate. This connection is your destiny, the greatest reward within the spiritual realm.

7 O SON OF MAN!

True love for me means letting go of selfishness. If you want to experience the joy I offer, focus on my will, not your own desires. This way, you'll find a deeper connection with me, and my love will fill you completely.

8 O SON OF SPIRIT!

You'll only find true peace by letting go of your ego and turning your heart towards me. Instead of seeking glory for yourself, find fulfillment in bringing glory to me. Trust in my guidance rather than relying solely on yourself, as your greatest purpose is to love me above all else.

9 O SON OF BEING!

My love is like a fortress. Those who find shelter in it will be safe and protected.  Those who turn away from this love will be lost and vulnerable.

10 O SON OF UTTERANCE!

I am your place of strength and safety. Come to me and find shelter. My love is always within you; remember that, and you'll feel my presence close by.

11 O SON OF BEING!

You are like a lamp, and my light shines within you. Let that light be your guide, and don't seek illumination from anything else. Remember, I created you with an abundance of gifts and blessings.

12 O SON OF BEING!

I crafted you with immense power and strength. Within you, I placed a spark of my own divine light. Be satisfied with this gift, and don't seek anything else. My creation is perfect, and my guidance is absolute. Trust this without question or doubt.

13 O SON OF SPIRIT!

I gave you abundance, so why do you choose a life lacking in richness? I made you with dignity, why do you degrade yourself? I gave you inner wisdom, why do you seek knowledge from others instead of trusting yourself? I created you from love, why do you get distracted by lesser things? Look within yourself; you'll find my strength and power residing there.

14 O SON OF MAN!

You are a part of me, and my essence is eternal; therefore, why do you fear your own end? You carry my light within you, and that light will never fade. Why are you afraid of disappearing? You reflect my glory, which is everlasting. You were created from my love, which will never wear out. Stay connected to this love, and you will discover me in the realm of eternal glory.

15 O SON OF UTTERANCE!

Focus solely on me, and let go of everything else. My power is everlasting, and my presence will never disappear. If you look for anything or anyone other than me, your search will be fruitless, even if it lasts for eternity.

16 O SON OF LIGHT!

Let go of everything else and connect with my spirit.  This is the most important thing I ask of you, so focus on this above all.

17 O SON OF MAN!

Find satisfaction in me alone, and don't seek help elsewhere. Only I can truly fulfill your needs.

18 O SON OF SPIRIT!

Don't ask me for things I don't intend for you. Instead, find contentment in what I have planned for your life. This path is the one that will truly benefit you.

19 O SON OF THE WONDROUS VISION!

I placed a spark of my own divine spirit within you, so you could love me deeply. Why have you turned away from me and found love in other things or people?

20 O SON OF SPIRIT!

I have a powerful claim on you that can never be broken. My blessings for you are endless and always visible. My love lives within you and cannot be hidden. My light shines brightly for you, and nothing can dim it.

21 O SON OF MAN!

I've offered you the greatest gifts imaginable. Why have you turned away and settled for less? Embrace these wonderful gifts and find true fulfillment.

22 O SON OF SPIRIT!

I created you with great potential, yet you underestimate yourself.  Embrace your true worth and rise to fulfill your purpose.

23 O SON OF THE SUPREME!

I offer you something that lasts forever, yet you focus on temporary things. Why have you turned away from what I want for you and instead chase your own fleeting desires?

24 O SON OF MAN!

Don't step out of line or take on more than you can handle. Show humility by bowing down before God, the all-powerful creator.

25 O SON OF SPIRIT!

Don't brag about being better off than those in need. I guide them through their struggles, and if you act with cruelty, you'll face trouble yourself.

26 O SON OF BEING!

Why focus on the flaws of others when you should be working on your own? Doing so brings a curse upon yourself.

27 O SON OF MAN!

Don't gossip about other people's mistakes when you have your own. If you do this, you'll be shut out from good things. Trust me, I've seen it happen.

28 O SON OF SPIRIT!

Understand this: Someone who tells others to be fair, but acts unfairly themselves, does not truly represent me [or my values], even if they claim to.

29 O SON OF BEING!

Don't say or do anything to another person that you wouldn't like said or done to yourself. This is my command, and it's important to obey it.

30 O SON OF MAN!

If someone in need asks for your help, don't refuse them. Think of them as an extension of me, and treat them with the respect you would show me.

31 O SON OF BEING!

Think about your actions every day, because you never know when you might die. When you die, you'll be judged for what you did in your life.

32 O SON OF THE SUPREME!

Instead of fearing death, see it as a path to something wonderful. Why be sad? I offer you a beautiful light, so why turn away from it?

33 O SON OF SPIRIT!

I bring you joyful news of light! Celebrate! I invite you to a holy place where you will live in peace forever.

34 O SON OF SPIRIT!

The spirit of holiness brings you the joy of reuniting with something wonderful. Why be sad? The spirit of power strengthens you on your path. Why hide yourself? The light of God's love guides you. How could you ever be lost?

35 O SON OF MAN!

Only feel sad if you're disconnected from your inner purpose. Celebrate the process of returning to that connection.

36 O SON OF MAN!

Find happiness within yourself, and this will prepare you for a greater spiritual connection.

37 O SON OF MAN!

Don't let go of the beautiful gifts I've given you, and don't miss out on the amazing things I have in store. If you do, you'll always feel empty and unfulfilled.

38 O SON OF BEING!

Follow my teachings because you love me. Put aside your own desires if you want to experience the joy I offer.

39 O SON OF MAN!

To show your love for me, follow my guidance. To experience the best life possible, remember my advice.

40 O SON OF MAN!

Even if you searched the entire universe, you would never find true peace unless you accept my guidance and show humility.

41 O SON OF MAN!

Spread my message, and in return, I will show you amazing things and guide you towards a fulfilling life.

42 O SON OF MAN!

Show humility towards me, and I will bless you. Fight for what I believe in, and you will be rewarded while you're still alive.

43 O SON OF BEING!

Speak about me to others, and I'll remember you with favor. This will bring both of us peace and joy.

44 O SON OF THE THRONE!

Everything you hear and see, I experience too. Use your senses to understand the goodness and holiness around you. In doing so, you'll discover your own special place in the world.

45 O SON OF BEING!

If serving my cause brings the possibility of death, accept it bravely. Find happiness in following my will and be grateful for my guidance. This will allow you to find peace and a place of honor with me.

46 O SON OF MAN!

Think carefully! Would you rather die peacefully in your bed, or give your life for my cause? By sacrificing yourself, you would become a powerful example of my teachings and bring my message of light to the greatest reward. Choose wisely, my follower!

47 O SON OF MAN!

By My beauty! To tinge thy hair with thy blood is greater in My sight than the creation of the universe and the light of both worlds. Strive then to attain this, O servant!

48 O SON OF MAN!

Here's how you know someone truly loves me: They remain strong when following my will, and they stay patient when facing challenges.

49 O SON OF MAN!

Someone with true love accepts hardships as part of the journey, just as someone troubled might long for forgiveness and help.

50 O SON OF MAN!

You can't truly understand and follow my path without facing challenges along the way. If you never experience hardship when trying to get closer to me, how can you fully appreciate the beauty of my love?

51 O SON OF MAN!

Even when difficult things happen, they can ultimately be for your good. While they might seem destructive on the surface, they can offer growth and a deeper spiritual connection. Embrace these challenges, and you'll find strength and lasting peace. This is my command, so follow it closely.

52 O SON OF MAN!

Don't get too excited about good times or too discouraged by bad times. Nothing lasts forever, so stay balanced.

53 O SON OF BEING!

If you're going through hardship, don't worry. Things will get better. Don't be afraid of feeling low, because you will find success and respect again.

54 O SON OF BEING!

If you desire a lasting spiritual connection and a life that extends beyond the physical world, then let go of your temporary power and worldly desires.

55 O SON OF BEING!

Don't focus too much on worldly things. Life's challenges are like a fire that tests the purity of precious metals, and I use those challenges to test the strength of my followers.

56 O SON OF MAN!

You crave material wealth, but I want you to break free from greed. You see material possessions as valuable, but I know your true worth comes from inner goodness. Our views on what's "valuable" are very different!

57 O SON OF MAN!

Help those in need with the resources I've given you. By doing so, you'll create a treasure of goodness and light for yourself in the afterlife. However, the most valuable thing you can offer is sacrificing your own desires to follow my path.

58 O SON OF MAN!

Your body and mind are my sacred space. Keep them clean of negative thoughts and actions, so my presence can dwell within you.

59 O SON OF BEING!

Let your heart be a pure and loving place, where I can reside. Keep your mind clear and open, so my guidance and knowledge can be revealed to you.

60 O SON OF MAN!

Open your heart and soul to me. Through this connection, I will transform you with my love and light.

61 O SON OF MAN!

Rise to the spiritual place where I dwell, and you will know the joy of being connected with me. There, you will find everlasting fulfillment and peace.

62 O SON OF MAN!

You've wasted so much time daydreaming and on unimportant things. Stop being lazy. Wake up and see the possibilities around you! I'm offering guidance and a fulfilling path â€“ open yourself to it.

63 O SON OF MAN!

A beautiful light has appeared within you, like a sunrise on a holy mountain. It's a spark of understanding and wisdom. Let go of your unimportant thoughts and embrace this light. By doing so, you'll prepare yourself for a life of peace and happiness, and be ready for a special connection with me. This path will free you from suffering and fear.

64 O SON OF MAN!

I offer you the possibility of a life that extends beyond the physical world. Embrace this gift and let it guide your actions. I have made the concept of unity and connection the foundation of existence. Live according to this principle and let your actions reflect the goodness and love that I offer.

65 O SON OF MAN!

My power and greatness are gifts I offer you. My love for you is the reason I give this freely. No one can fully comprehend my ways. I have always held this gift in reserve, ready to bestow it upon those who seek me, as a sign of my love and care.

66 O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE!

You won't always fully understand my love, and people will often question your devotion. This is because my ways are too vast for the human mind and heart to completely comprehend.

67 O SON OF BEAUTY!

My love and generosity are so great! Everything I've shown you and explained to you, I've done in a way that you can understand. My true power and the depth of my love are far beyond what you can fully grasp.

68 O CHILDREN OF MEN!

Don't think you're better than anyone else! Remember, we all come from the same source. Because of this, we should treat each other like family: with love, cooperation, and living together in peace. If you follow this advice, your life will blossom with goodness and a deep sense of purpose.

69 O YE SONS OF SPIRIT!

You are very precious to me. I have gifted you with understanding and wisdom. Protect this special knowledge from those who would misuse it or reject it entirely.

70 O SON OF HIM THAT STOOD BY HIS OWN ENTITY IN THE KINGDOM OF HIS SELF!

Understand that I've offered you guidance and a good path to follow. I have given you blessings and want you to have everything that brings me joy. Accept my plan for you and be grateful.

71 O SON OF MAN!

My teachings are the most important thing. Ideally, fully understand them and let them guide your choices. If that's not possible, at least try to live them with your whole heart. The ultimate way to prove your love for me is through sacrifice. Following my path, even when it's difficult, has the greatest meaning for me.

### Part Two

**From the Persian**

*In the Name of the Lord of Utterance, the Mighty.*

1 O YE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MINDS TO KNOW AND EARS TO HEAR!

Beloved seeker, focus only on the path of spiritual growth and inner wisdom. Dedicate yourself fully to love and true understanding. Remain steadfast on your journey and don't get distracted. In doing so, you'll discover your true purpose and a deep, lasting connection within yourself.

2 O SON OF SPIRIT!

Birds naturally fly back to their nests, and nightingales are drawn to roses. But humans, with their hearts like birds, often settle for temporary pleasures like dust. They forget their true home, which is a connection with something divine. It's a shame! They trade a tiny cup for a vast ocean of love from God, and miss out on a life filled with light and beauty.

3 O FRIEND!

Let love be the only flower that grows in your heart. Hold onto your feelings of kindness and desire for goodness. Spend time with people who share your values, and avoid those who don't.

4 O SON OF JUSTICE!

A person deeply in love naturally wants to be close to the one they love. Just like someone searching for something precious wouldn't rest until they find it, true love seeks connection. Reunion with the beloved is like life itself, while being apart feels like death. Someone truly in love can't be patient and their heart aches when separated. They would give up anything to be reunited.

5 O SON OF DUST!

The worst kind of person is someone who loves to argue for no reason and always tries to be better than others. Remember, actions speak louder than words.

6 O SON OF EARTH!

If you hold on to any jealousy within your heart, you'll never find true peace and the spiritual connection I offer. You'll never experience the goodness that comes from a life of love and purpose.

7 O SON OF LOVE!

You're very close to making a huge spiritual leap forward in your life! Just a little more effort will bring you to a level of love and understanding you never imagined. Listen closely to the guidance I offer.

8 O SON OF GLORY!

Focus on spiritual growth and connect with me. Purify your thoughts and seek a closer relationship with me, and you'll find great peace and understanding.

9 O FLEETING SHADOW!

Let go of doubt and embrace absolute faith. Discover the truth within yourself, and you'll see the pure goodness and beauty around you. When you do, you'll be filled with wonder and gratitude!

10 O SON OF DESIRE!

You cannot find beauty in something you don't understand or connect with. You must find something within yourself first. It's a principle of nature â€“ like attracts like.

11 O SON OF DUST!

Let go of distractions so you can focus on what truly matters. Block out the noise of the world to hear my guidance. Let go of ego and preconceived notions to accept my wisdom. Don't get distracted by material things, so you can understand the vastness of my love and support. When you do this, with clarity, a pure heart, and focused attention, you'll discover true peace and connection.

12 O MAN OF TWO VISIONS!

Ignore the distractions of the world and temporary pleasures. Instead, focus on cultivating a deeper spiritual connection and understanding of the divine.

13 O MY CHILDREN!

I'm worried that if you don't listen to the messages of spiritual guidance and love that I offer, you will be lost and unhappy. If you never open yourself up to the beauty and goodness available, you will simply go through life and remain unchanged.

14 O FRIENDS!

Don't be fooled by temporary pleasures. Focus on what has lasting value and meaning, not things that fade away.

15 O SON OF SPIRIT!

A time will come when you'll no longer have access to the beautiful truth I offer. You won't be able to hear the voice of spiritual guidance. Don't miss out on this opportunity now!

16 O ESSENCE OF NEGLIGENCE!

I'm trying to share wonders and wisdom with you in so many ways, but it seems like no one is listening or able to grasp my meaning.

17 O COMRADES!

The path to spiritual connection is always open, and those who sacrifice for love find the greatest reward. However, most people don't make the effort to truly seek this connection. Of those who do, very few do so with genuine sincerity and a clear heart.

18 O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST PARADISE!

My devoted followers, a beautiful new path to spiritual growth and connection has opened! Those who follow it will find joy and deeper understanding. Work hard to reach this place of wisdom and love, and you will experience happiness and peace.

19 O MY FRIENDS!

Have you forgotten that special time when we were all together in a beautiful, holy place? I spoke to you then under a tree of life, a symbol of lasting spiritual growth. Here's what I said then, and it's still true today: Don't choose your own path over mine, don't crave things I don't want for you, and don't approach me with hearts full of worldly desires. If you purify your hearts, you'll remember that time and my words, and the truth will be clear to you.

*In the eighth of the most holy lines, in the fifth Tablet of Paradise, He saith:*

20 O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS!

A lot of time has passed, and you're nearing the end of your lives. Yet, you haven't shown any true devotion to me. You claim to believe in the one true God, but your actions say otherwise. You've embraced things that go against my will. Despite this, you live comfortably, unaware that the world around you is tired of your ways. If you could see things clearly, you'd realize this supposed happiness is hollow, and you'd rather face hardship or even death.

21 O MOVING FORM OF DUST!

I want a close relationship with you, but you don't trust me. Your rebellious ways have destroyed your hopes and dreams. I'm always close by, but you continually push me away. I have something wonderful planned for you, but you've chosen a path that will only lead to disappointment. It's not too late â€“ change your ways before this opportunity is lost forever.

22 O SON OF DESIRE!

Wise and knowledgeable people have spent their whole lives dedicated to finding a spiritual connection, but they were unsuccessful. You, without even trying, found what you were looking for. However, you are so focused on yourself that you couldn't even see the blessing right in front of you. This should amaze anyone who understands.

23 O DWELLERS IN THE CITY OF LOVE!

Attacks have been made against those who represent good, and those who are pure are suffering greatly. Those who are responsible for this suffering will face unfortunate consequences while those who ignore it are falsely confident that they are on the right path. This is foolish!

24 O YE THAT ARE FOOLISH, YET HAVE A NAME TO BE WISE!

Why do you pretend to be spiritual guides when you truly want to harm those who follow me? You are like a false star that seems to offer light, but actually leads people away from safety and down a destructive path.

25 O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL!

You appear good on the surface, but inside you are not genuine. When you are truly tested, your intentions are revealed. Just like the sun shines on dirt and a mirror, but one reflects nothing while the other reflects light, your inner self is far different from what you project to the world.

26 O MY FRIEND IN WORD!

Think about this carefully: It's impossible to truly love both your friends and your enemies. Push out negativity and make room for love in your heart.

27 O SON OF DUST!

I have given you so much, and I want the greatest gift of all to be a connection with me. The human heart can be a place of beauty and connection with the divine. Instead, you have filled your heart with other things. When I tried to find a place in your heart, someone or something else was already there, and I had to leave. Even so, I understand and protect your privacy, without judging you.

28 O ESSENCE OF DESIRE!

Often, when I've looked for you, I've found you distracted by worldly things and not focused on our connection. When I see this, I quietly leave, without disturbing others with your neglect.

29 O SON OF BOUNTY!

I created you and gave you everything you need to thrive. Since the time you were born, I've provided for you and protected you. I did all this so you could find true connection with me and have a wonderful life. But you ignored my gifts and focused on unimportant things. You've forgotten all I've done and drifted away from me.

30 O BONDSLAVE OF THE WORLD!

Often I've tried to send feelings of love and guidance your way, but found that you're not paying attention. When I see this, I feel sad for you and quietly withdraw.

31 O SON OF EARTH!

If you want to truly understand my love for you, focus only on our connection. Don't be distracted by less important things. Your desire to be connected to me, and your desire for earthly things, are like fire and water â€“ they can't exist in the same place.

32 O BEFRIENDED STRANGER!

I've given you the potential for spiritual understanding. Don't let doubt and selfish desires extinguish this light. To find peace and happiness, always remember our connection. Value my love above all else.

33 O MY BROTHER!

Listen carefully to the beautiful things I have to teach you, and absorb my words like a sweet, refreshing drink. Plant my wisdom within your heart and nourish it with certainty. Let understanding and insight blossom within you.

34 O DWELLERS OF MY PARADISE!

With love and care, I've nurtured a connection with you. I've given you many blessings to help it grow. Now, as this relationship strengthens, do your best to protect it. Don't let it be destroyed by selfish desires.

35 O MY FRIENDS!

Let go of your mistakes and let my guidance light your path. Soon, you will be judged based solely on your actions and the goodness within your heart.

36 O SON OF DUST!

Truly wise people don't share wisdom unless someone is ready to listen, just like when a cup-bearer doesn't offers a cup until he sees someone is thirsty, or a lover who longs for someone wouldn't shout their feelings unless they see their beloved. Plant seeds of knowledge in a pure and open heart, and keep them safe until the time is right for them to blossom.

*In the first line of the Tablet it is recorded and written, and within the sanctuary of the tabernacle of God is hidden:*

37 O MY SERVANT!

Don't trade a lasting spiritual connection for temporary earthly pleasures. This guidance I give you is like a life-giving river â€“ those who follow my teachings will find fulfillment!

38 O SON OF SPIRIT!

Let go of the things that hold you back, and like the mythical phoenix, rise up with love and embrace a higher purpose. Dedicate yourself to kindness and find a true spiritual connection.

39 O OFFSPRING OF DUST!

Don't become complacent in the fleeting joys of the material world. It's a trap that will ultimately leave you unfulfilled. Don't trade the possibility of finding true spiritual peace for something temporary. Break free from the ties that bind you to earthly concerns and embrace the limitless freedom of a connection with something divine.

40 O MY SERVANT!

Break free from the things that hold you back, and let go of your selfish desires. This opportunity to find inner peace and a greater purpose won't last forever, so take action now!

41 O SON OF MY HANDMAID!

If you could see the beauty and peace of a lasting spiritual connection, you would leave behind the temporary pleasures of this world without hesitation. The reason I don't make this obvious is complex, and only those with pure hearts truly understand this.

42 O MY SERVANT!

Let go of negative feelings like jealousy and resentment, and open yourself to experiencing true kindness and a deeper spiritual connection.

43 O MY FRIENDS!

Act in ways that bring happiness to the one you love (here, referring to a higher power or spiritual connection). Remember, true love involves respecting the other's wishes. Don't intrude, take what's not yours, or force your own way. Think about this carefully, if you have the understanding!

44 O COMPANION OF MY THRONE!

Don't focus on negative things. Don't spread gossip. Be kind, stay humble, and focus on being a good person. Live life to the fullest and try to find a connection to something bigger than yourself.

45 ALAS! ALAS! O LOVERS OF WORLDLY DESIRE!

You've ignored the true path and my teachings, and instead have focused on unimportant things. You've convinced yourselves that these less important things are valuable. You haven't tried to live a pure, good life and you have followed your selfish desires.

46 O BRETHREN IN THE PATH!

Why aren't you focused on me [God] and seeking a spiritual connection? Beauty and truth are right here, yet you argue over pointless things. A wonderful, fulfilling life is possible, but you're ignoring it. I feel bad for you and anyone who chooses this path.

47 O CHILDREN OF DESIRE!

Let go of your ego and stop being so proud.

*In the third of the most holy lines writ and recorded in the Ruby Tablet by the pen of the unseen this is revealed:*

48 O BRETHREN!

Be patient with each other and don't focus on material things. Don't get too full of yourself, or be overly sad about setbacks. Remember, I created everything from equal origins, and eventually, everything returns to that same state.

49 O CHILDREN OF DUST!

The poor often suffer in silence. Ignoring this suffering hurts everyone. True wealth comes from giving and helping others.

50 O QUINTESSENCE OF PASSION!

Don't always want more, and be satisfied with what you have. Greedy people are never truly happy, while those content with what they have are loved and appreciated.

51 O SON OF MY HANDMAID!

Don't worry if you're poor or brag if you're rich. Money comes and goes. The real treasure is a deep connection with God. If you have nothing else but that connection, it's an amazing gift. It will bring you true happiness and understanding. Everyone is ultimately poor without God, and God has everything. When you connect with God, it's like a beautiful sunrise filling your heart with love and security.

52 O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE AND PASSION! 

You've let bad influences into your life and pushed away a true friend (referring to God or a higher power). You've focused on loving other things more. Listen to the teachings I offer and seek a connection with me. Unlike worldly friends who may have ulterior motives, I truly love you and have sacrificed to help you. Don't be ungrateful â€“ turn back to me. This message is a beacon of truth and comes from the one who created everything. Open your mind and listen to the words of God, who will always be there for you and is the source of all existence.

53 O YE THAT PRIDE YOURSELVES ON MORTAL RICHES!

Being wealthy can be a big obstacle to finding spiritual connection and inner peace. Most rich people never achieve this. However, some wealthy people do manage to use their wealth in positive ways and don't let it stand in the way of understanding what's truly important. That kind of generosity and goodness benefits everyone!

54 O YE RICH ONES ON EARTH!

The poor are a gift I have entrusted to you. Help those in need, and don't focus only on your own comfort.

55 O SON OF PASSION!

Let go of your attachment to material wealth, and embrace simpler, more spiritual life. This will give you peace and a deeper understanding of what truly matters.

56 O MY SON!

Hanging out with negative people brings you down, while spending time with good people makes your heart better. If you want to connect with God, befriend those who love God. If you want to hear God's message, listen to the teachings of those God has chosen.

57 O SON OF DUST!

Be careful! Don't spend time with people who act in harmful ways or have bad values. Doing so can corrupt you and turn good into bad within your own heart.

58 O SON OF MY HANDMAID!

If you want to experience the love and guidance of a higher power (Holy Spirit), spend time with good people (righteous). These people have a deep spiritual connection (drunk from the cup) and can help you find yours too (quicken and illumine the hearts of the dead).

59 O HEEDLESS ONES!

Don't think you can hide what's truly in your heart. God (or the holy Presence) sees your innermost thoughts and feelings clearly.

60 O FRIENDS!

I [God] know your deepest secrets and inner thoughts, even the ones you hide. The fact that I don't expose these is an act of kindness, not something you deserve.

61 O SON OF MAN!

I offer something wonderful to all people, but no one seems to want it. They choose lesser things and ignore the beauty of a spiritual connection I offer. What they've settled for isn't good enough.

62 O SON OF DUST!

Don't ignore the amazing spiritual connection I offer for temporary, unimportant things. Embrace the possibility of a fulfilling, lasting life through connecting with me. This will bring you true wisdom and the ability to hear my guidance. Everyone who chases unimportant things â€“ why did you turn away from the beautiful, lasting gift I offer and focus on temporary things?

63 O YE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD!

Know that you will face consequences for your bad actions, and those consequences will be severe. Don't think I don't see what you've done. Everything you've done is recorded for all time.

64 O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH!

Stop being a cruel or unfair to others. I cannot and will not forgive this kind of behavior. This is my promise, and nothing can change it.

65 O REBELLIOUS ONES!

My patience has made you bold and careless. You've gone down a dangerous path fueled by your desires, and it will lead to disaster. Don't think I haven't noticed or don't care.

66 O EMIGRANTS!

I intended for speech to be used in a positive, uplifting way. Don't gossip or speak badly about others. If you feel tempted to judge someone else, focus on fixing your own flaws instead. Remember, you know yourself better than anyone else does.

67 O CHILDREN OF FANCY!

Even though bad things are currently being done in secret, the truth will come to light. Eventually, everyone will see the wrongdoings that are now hidden.

68 O WEED THAT SPRINGETH OUT OF DUST!

Why are you trying to connect with me [God] when your actions haven't been good, and you're focused on selfish desires? Fix yourself first, and then you'll be worthy of a true spiritual connection. You aren't even close to achieving this.

69 O CHILDREN OF ADAM!

Kind words rise like incense to the heavens, and good deeds pave the golden path to God's embrace. Cleanse your actions from pride and self-serving desires, for only pure virtue will find favor in the divine court.

70 O SON OF WORLDLINESS!

There's a wonderful, peaceful state of existence you can reach. It's beyond the limitations of this life and offers true happiness. If you connect with a higher power (celestial Youth) and experience this spiritual connection, you'll be free from suffering, sin, and the troubles of the world.

71 O MY FRIENDS!

Remember the promise you made to me long ago, when we were in a sacred place. I made the angels witness this promise, and yet, no one seems to keep it anymore. Pride and arrogance have caused you to break our agreement, and you've lost your way. Even though I see this, I've waited patiently, hoping you'll change.

72 O MY SERVANT!

You are like a beautiful sword hidden away â€“ great potential, but unseen. Let go of your ego and selfish desires so that your true value can shine and everyone will see your worth.

73 O MY FRIEND!

You have the potential to light up the world with kindness and goodness. Don't let negativity and distractions hold you back. Break free of things that don't matter so you can shine brightly and make a positive impact.

74 O CHILDREN OF VAINGLORY!

You've traded something that lasts forever (spiritual connection) for something temporary (worldly pleasures). You brag about these meaningless things. But remember, everyone dies in the end, and all these distinctions will fade away. Only those who choose to follow my path (purging from every color) will have something lasting.

75 O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE!

Don't get too attached to the good things in life or feel too proud of them. They won't last forever. Imagine a happy bird singing on a branch â€“ then a hunter comes and everything ends. That's how life can be. So be careful, people who only focus on what you want!

76 O SON OF MY HANDMAID!

Advice was once given only with words, but now I expect action. Anyone can talk, but only good people consistently do good things. Focus wholeheartedly on making your actions reflect kindness and a higher purpose. This is my guidance, written clearly and brightly for you to follow.

77 O SON OF JUSTICE!

A divine presence waited faithfully for a sign of humanity's devotion but found none. Instead, good people were suffering at the hands of the wicked. This caused great sorrow and lamenting even in the highest of spiritual realms.  A compassionate, heavenly figure emerged, wanting to know who was suffering. However, learning even a small part of the answer had profound effects, and a voice declared that not everything could be revealed.  We witness and acknowledge the suffering of the righteous.

78 O SON OF MY HANDMAID!

Listen to my teachings and they will bring you wisdom and understanding. Plant my lessons deep within your heart and nourish them with certainty. From this, knowledge will bloom within you like a beautiful flower.

79 O SON OF DESIRE!

Why do you keep focusing on selfish desires? I've given you the potential to reach spiritual heights, not waste your time on unimportant things. I've given you tools to use in positive ways, so why use them as weapons instead?

80 O MY SERVANTS!

You are like trees in my garden. Just like a tree produces fruit, you should do good things in the world that benefit yourself and others. Everyone should find a useful skill or job, because that's how you create a good life (wealth) â€“ be smart about it! Remember, hard work is important, but God's help will also be with you. If you don't contribute anything, you're like a useless tree â€“ eventually something will happen.

81 O MY SERVANT!

The worst kind of people are those who don't do anything good with their lives. They're basically like dead people already, and in fact, God would rather have someone who died than someone who just lives without purpose.

82 O MY SERVANT!

The best people are those who have a job they work at and use their earnings to take care of themselves and their families. They do this because it pleases God.

*Something beautiful that was hidden is now revealed! It is a wonderful gift from God. This is proof that God is good. It's time to see what you can do when you give up your attachment to earthly things and embrace a higher purpose. This wonderful blessing has been given to everyone! All praise to God!*
